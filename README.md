Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
  The goal of the project for this course was to create a thermostat where the temperature can be increased and decreased by pressing two different buttons. 

What did you do particularly well?
  One thing that I did well was dividing the project into smaller and more manageable pieces that I could then tackle one at a time. This made planning out the project a lot easier as well and helped me establish a good flow in the program and reduce the amount of time I needed to spend debugging.

Where could you improve?
  An area I could improve would be transfering the program from the design stage into code. It was partially difficult going diagrams that I was less familiar with instead of relying entirely on pseudo-code for planning out a project.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Throughout this course, I learned a lot about embeded systems and how to program them which could provide more possible options for future projects as a means to overcome certain issues that I may run into.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  Being able to plan out and break a project into smaller pieces are skills which I will be able to take from this class and apply it to any future projects and course work.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this project readable, adaptable and maintainable by following good coding practices. This would include using descriptive and simple variable names, concise comments for code and making use of functions to break up the code and lessen the amount of repeated code.
